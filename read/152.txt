" The problem 
Product packaging, ripe for a remake
 
Thrasio acquired Angry Orange, a commercial-grade pet deodorizing concentrate, in 2018.
 The four-year-old brand brought in about $2 million in annual revenue.
 Still, its packaging was as uninspired as its competitors’.
 Beyond that, it lacked a strong identity that told a story and engaged customers.
 
“Amazon is an exceptionally visual medium,” said John Hefter, Thrasio’s SVP of creative and brand strategy.
 “We buy with our eyes first.
 When you scroll down the page, what makes your eye stop?” John’s creative team cued up a complete rebrand of Angry Orange, starting with the bottle.

 The solution Color commentary is key to rebranding  First up: design a bright orange bottle that would stand out in a sea of sameness.
 To confirm that the color change would be worth it, Thrasio turned to PickFu.
 
The team ran poll after poll with 800 shoppers in all, adjusting the design after each round.
 “The evidence became very clear that the bright new orange design was going to motivate people to purchase," John said.

Insights gleaned from continual testing on PickFu helped guide not only the bottle and label redesign, but also the product imagery, video content, and creation of a ready-to-use Angry Orange spray.
