Amazon Aggregators Firms acquiring successful brands on Amazon have attracted over $15 billion in capital raised.
 They are known as Amazon seller aggregators.
 The market had a breakout year in 2020 because of three factors: the pandemic accelerating spending on Amazon, Thrasio raising hundreds of millions of dollars, and Anker, an Amazon-native brand, going public.
 There are 98 active Amazon aggregators.
 59 aggregators have announced funding rounds, of which 34 raised at least $100 million.
 Most aggregators are based in the United States; however, there are also companies operating in Belgium, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Turkey, UAE and United Kingdom.
 The capital pouring in is validating the Amazon marketplace as something serious.
 The businesses that sell on Amazon have grown mainly relying on measurable demand, controllable unit economics, and the predictability the data-rich marketplace provides through tools like Jungle Scout, Helium 10, and others.
 The firms rolling up those businesses use the same principles to evaluate and value them and grow them post-purchase.
 The types of companies those firms are looking to acquire are most often private-label sellers that use Amazon as one of their primary sources of distribution (some are also looking at brands using Shopify).
 There is no demand for resellers, nor do other marketplaces play a significant role.

 Amazon-dependency is both the most significant risk and the fuel that powers those firms.
 But there are dozens of additional challenges yet to be resolved.
 For example: transferring the scrappiness of a one-person seller to an employee of a firm, long-term risk of brands on Amazon, building a brand vs.
 being operationally efficient, buying brands vs.
 building brands in-house, avoiding suspensions, and others.
 Money for most of those firms came first; they will spend the next year figuring out the model that could work and scale.
