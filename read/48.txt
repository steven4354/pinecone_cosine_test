Thrasio Acquires Yardline to Offer E-Commerce Funding

June 16, 2021
 | By: Kevin Travers 


Amazon merchant conglomerate Thrasio bought Yardline to incorporate e-commerce finance into the product offering.
 Thrasio has been active with Yardline since the firm’s initial backing of the company, and is now making Yardline a wholly owned subsidiary.
 
Yardline Chief Revenue Officer Seth Broman said that historically, e-commerce has been risky with no barrier to entry like traditional brick and mortar shops.
 Broman added that online stores used to be for supplements, but through Amazon’s third-party marketplace and Shopify’s help, scaling a quality business has become possible.
 
“Through COVID, the script was flipped,” Broman wrote in a statement.
 “E-commerce businesses became less risky, and brick-and-mortar businesses suffered the most.
 It’s also a much smaller universe and harder to target than a brick-and-mortar business.
”
Thrasio boasts it is the largest acquirer of Amazon brands globally, and co-founder and co-CEO Carlos Cashman said 40% of brands they approach end up selling.
 Now, they can help scale those brands.
 
“Yardline will be an asset in creating more opportunities for these entrepreneurs and offering more sophisticated avenues for growth,” Cashman said in a statement.
 “They’ve been doing something different in the space—their strategic approach to providing embedded capital across e-commerce marketplaces is unique—and we’re eager to have their technology and proficiency on our team.
”
Tomo Matsuo, president of Yardline, will be joining Thrasio’s senior leadership team.
 “It’s conceivable that every eCommerce-related platform will have FinTech capabilities in the future,” he said in a statement.
 “And our acquisition by Thrasio demonstrates that.
