Thrasio Thrasio is an American company that acquires and develops Amazon businesses.
 Before Thrasio buys a business, it analyzes countless factors, such as conversion rates, seasonality, costs and revenues, and after the business is bought, Thrasio utilizes AI algorithms to build a strategy that will maximize the sales of products.

Thrasio is a good way for Amazon retailers to exit, since often they are not large enough to be listed on an exchange.
 An average purchase of a business takes slightly over a month.
 The company has already acquired over a hundred businesses, for which it paid $150 million in total.
 Thrasio is headquartered in Walpole, MA.
