  Once a brand is identified and locked, the acquisition process is straightforward.
 A deal is drawn up with a signed Letter of Intent, after which Thrasio deep dives into the brand’s financials and explores the seller’s Amazon account.
 Once this due diligence is completed, Thrasio makes its payment and the seller transfers his assets in a span of 7-14 days.
 The LOI closes within 30-32 days.
 The agreement is structured so that earnouts are included for sellers.
 Such an agreement allows sellers to continue to profit as Thrasio grows their business.

 The   Thrasio was derived from an Amazon warrior in Greek Mythology named "Thraso" which translates to "confidence.
"    The company came into existence because the founders identified an untapped opportunity.
 Traditionally, the exit routes available to small business owners at Amazon have only been passingly lucrative.
 An owner looking to sell their business could sell them directly to an individual who would fund the purchase with a loan or personal financing.
 This method did not involve in-cash transactions and contained the risk of a buyer pulling out.
 The other method was to list the business with a broker, who would facilitate the sale with a buyer and take a percentage cut.
 This method had the downside of unreasonably high commissions charged by brokers.

    However, with the establishment of Thrasio, the founders presented a new kind of model which keeps the sellers content by providing them with a fair, fast, and profitable exit strategy.
 The process of acquisition is very transparent and expresses all expectations from the startup.
 The terms of the deal are well-perceived by sellers because Thrasio pays well and even shares post-sale gains through their earnout arrangements.
 According to the founders, this is in fact the company’s very secret to success and core value – the relationships they build with their sellers.
 The other value they highlight is the synergies they build with their own teams.
