  Thrasio have announced they will acuire Lifelong Online, a leading Indian online consumer brand, marking Thrasio’s entrance into India with a ₹3750 core commitment to acquire the region’s promising, digital-first brands in the country.
  This is a really interesting move as India is one of the fastest-growing regions for Amazon’s third-party marketplace, making it enticing for aggregators.
 India’s inward investment regulations make it very difficult to trade in the region without an Indian based company so this puts Thrasio ahead of the pack in this region both for acquiring Indian brands to market to the rest of the world and for selling on Amazon India.
 With Lifelong leading the on-the-ground execution, Thrasio gains the strength of a knowledgeable, local company to run the Indian business.
 Backed by Thrasio’s extensive experience and the ₹3750 crore commitment to acquire Indian businesses, the company will quickly be a significant player in the seller ecosystem.
   We couldn’t be more excited to work with Lifelong Online and, together, take our proven model to India,.
 As we got to know Lifelong, it became clear that they are the ideal partner for what we want to accomplish.
 Their team of proven executives has already built an amazing business, and their understanding of the Indian consumer is unparalleled.
 Their expertise and local leadership will be invaluable as we make an enduring commitment to India.
 In addition to acquiring and growing digital-first businesses, we plan to participate in the ‘make in India’ movement by transitioning the manufacturing for some of our products to the country.
  India is a unique market with hundreds of thousands of motivated entrepreneurs,” continued Cashman.
 “We are thrilled to provide brand owners with the opportunity to successfully sell their businesses as well as to give consumers greater access to quality products.
 This is a major step in our evolution and a huge opportunity for India’s sellers  Thrasio has acquired more than 200 brands and raised more than $3.
4 billion (USD) in funding and will continue to deploy those funds around the globe to acquire businesses with promise.
 Their entrance brings the firm with the most aggregation experience to the Indian market, while Lifelong Online provides insight into Indian consumers and the local ecommerce ecosystem.
   Lifelong will now be known as “Lifelong, a Thrasio company” and will be well-positioned to engage with India’s more than 750,000 sellers.
    We are building a technology-first, next-generation consumer goods company.
 Thrasio’s acquisition expertise and the strength of our platform across ecommerce, D2C, Amazon, and Flipkart are a perfect match.
 We are already in active discussions with a number of sellers, and we’re excited to help Indian entrepreneurs realize the full potential of their brands and products.
 With lucrative exit options for founders, we hope to encourage even more brands and sellers to join the D2C ecosystem in India! Bharat Kalia and the team from Lifelong, a Thrasio company are available to meet sellers at every stage.
 Indian businesses that are thinking of selling or believe their products have viability to expand should visit lifelongthrasio.
