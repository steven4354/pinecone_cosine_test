                 Thrasio, the leader among Amazon aggregators, acquired three brands in the second quarter of this year that together have a total value of $100 million, the company announced on Wednesday.
  Amazon aggregators, or rollups, are companies that buy up successful brands on Amazon and apply economies of scale, sophisticated marketing techniques, and omnichannel implementation to make them even more profitable.
  The company did not disclose the breakdown on the individual deals.
 The move is significant as it signals a shift on Thrasio's part to larger deal sizes.
 With $1.
7 billion in funding, the company can afford to select high-dollar brands.
 In fact, Thrasio said that its average deal size has more than doubled.
  "Lately, we have been acquiring more brands making at least $3 million in annual revenue.
 We will still give a look at some deals smaller than that, but our average deal size has increased," said Thrasio CEO Carlos Cashman.
 "As competition increases in this space, we think there's additional value and opportunity with these larger deals.
" The company's funding and the size of its recent deal differentiate it from the dozens of competitors in the aggregator space.
 CEO Cashman said that it will not exclude smaller deals from the mix, however.
 "If we believe that a brand has untapped potential, and we have the capability to tap into that potential, then we'll look into the acquisition," he said.

                         The three companies signed are category leaders: SafeRest, a leading seller of mattress protectors;  Wise Owl Outfitters, a popular camping equipment retailer; and Danjor Linens, which specializes in affordable, high-quality bedding.
 In making the announcement, Thrasio said that these three brands are expected to generate more than $90 million in sales for the company over the course of their first year.
   Thrasio has experienced exponential growth in the three years since its founding.
 The company now employs more than 1,000 people in eight locations spanning the globe from New York to China.
 Cashman said his company is focused on keeping customer experience during the deal process at a premium level regardless of the pace of its growth and the rapidity at which it makes acquisitions.
  "The strategy remains the same as it always has — we evaluate brands transparently and fairly, and we make an offer where, we believe, everyone wins," he said.
 "We've put together a great team, and we continue to add to it to ensure the deal process runs as smoothly as possible.
" With this acquisition, Thrasio said that one in 10 US households owns a product from one of the brands under its umbrella.
