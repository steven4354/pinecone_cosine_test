 Acquisitions also have the elements of a zero-sum game.
  The bullish sentiments of venture funds in the space roll up business model feels very much like a bubble in the market.
 These emerging startups themselves have yet to prove that the strategy to acquire, integrate and consolidate these equally young D2C brands works.
 The numbers and assets that look good on paper may not be the real winning factors once the deal is through and execution begins.
 Thrasio's business model is fairly straightforward.
Â They find and buy category-leading consumer product small businesses that operate on Amazon's platform.
Â After acquiring the firms, they integrate them into their systems and marketing programs.
Â This makes the individual firms more efficient and provides Thrasio with economies of scale.
Â The process is fast, and it gives within a few weeks the option for Amazon sellers to exit theirÂ business.
 Currently, Thrasio operates on Amazonâ€™s platform in the U.
S.
 as well as Japan and Europe.
 It plans to expand to India.
 It certainly makes sense that the business is named after the ancient Greek word thrasos, the concept of audacity and boldness.
