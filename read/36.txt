   Initially, the rollup model in India was looked at with a lot of skepticism due to the size of the Indian E-commerce Markets ($56 Bn in India in 2021, as compared to almost $760 Bn in US) and a limited number of successful brands (4,153 Amazon brands in India doing annual revenue upwards of INR 1Cr or $150K as compared to over 50K Amazon brands doing more than $1Mn in annual revenue in US).

 Below are the models adopted in the Indian Markets – 

   #1 The ‘House of Brands’ Model:  
This is the strategy that has been adopted by many across the globe.
 The idea behind this approach is to acquire brands across categories, whether it is home & kitchen, garden & outdoor, or fashion & lifestyle, and leverage economies of scale by merging common resources/functions required to bring in efficiency.
 
 
For Example: If Company A acquires 5 brands across 5 different categories which are all sourcing from China, now since they are all owned & managed by Company A, they can easily combine the order quantities to get better sourcing rates and bring in a FCL (full container load) rather than a LCL (Less than Container Load) to reduce the supply chain cost for their products as well.
  
 
The likes of Thrasio, Mensa, Globalbees, 10Club, Upscalio, Goat Brand Labs, and few others are focusing on this approach wherein they are looking to acquire online-first brands across categories.
 Each one of them is building their expertise in few categories but the core idea remains the same of being a ‘House of Brands’.

Under this model, companies are focusing on leveraging their core strengths in certain segments where they possess a stronghold on the markets.
 Here, the idea is to pick a category and dominate the same by building a multi-brand portfolio in that category.
  
 
Good Glamm has established its own thesis of going after ‘content to commerce’ brands serving the Beauty & Personal Care (BPC) markets and has acquired brands like ScoopWhoop, Winkl, Vidooly, MissMalini on the content side along with The Moms Co.
, Organic Harvest, Sirona, and St.
 Botanica on the product side to strengthen its position in this segment.
  
 
On another hand, the likes of Cure Foods and Rebel Foods have placed their bet on the non-home cooked food consumption in India which is still merely at 10% in comparison to 54% in the US and they are building a portfolio of brands in the F&B segment.
  
 
Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Limited (ABFRL), is one of the latest entrants in this space that decided to join the Thrasio-style bandwagon.
 With its investments in Masaba, Tasva, Sabyasachi etc.
, the company aims to leverage its capabilities around design, product creation, sourcing, and brand building in the offline space, while creating a fashion and lifestyle products-led portfolio in the digital space as well.
 
 
Not just ABFRL, but in fact the likes of Boat, Nykaa, and Join Ventures have also recently announced and entered with their category-specific thesis on this model to expand and acquire multiple businesses.

Acquisition Style:

India is a developing economy and e-commerce adoption is still growing at a rapid pace; Online brands are witnessing strong year-on-year growth (even over 100% in some categories), which makes it less enticing for brand owners to consider a 100% buyout today as they would want to be associated with the brand for a longer tenure to bear the fruits of growth.
  
This gave birth to different structures conceived by the aggregators to get brand owners associated with them while benefitting from the future growth brought in by both – the aggregator and the brand owner.

 Here, the aggregators acquire anywhere between 51-76% of the business today and the remaining stake is acquired over a period of time.
 The future acquisition multiples (either based on EBITDA/Revenue) are pre-defined today, while the Revenue/EBITDA is kept uncapped, giving brand owners a chance to maximize their valuation through a significant growth in the business.
 This also keeps the brand owners equally incentivized in growing the brand to the next level.

Since 2015, Amazon has been promoting Indian businesses abroad to help them reach global consumers with its export-focused global seller program.
 So far, the company has helped over 70,000 Indian sellers reach 17 international markets and the e-commerce exports of Indian-made products cumulatively crossed $3 Bn since the start of this program.
  
 
It took Amazon India 3 years to hit the $1 Bn milestone in exports, whereas the next billion was achieved in 18 months and the third one took only a year to be achieved.
 This showcases that Indian-made products can match & compete with international brands/products, and Amazon anticipates this trend to grow further and expects to touch $10 Bn in exports of Indian-made goods by 2025.

D2C Brands have seen an uptick in interest from investors and have tripled the capital raised in 2021 as compared to 2020, summing over $2 Bn, however, the number of deals remained stagnant (105 deals in 2021 as compared to 97 in 2020) which suggests that investors are picking their bets quite cautiously and at the same time the bar to be differentiated for upcoming brands has gone up with funding being polarized towards deep innovation in products and consumer proposition.
  
 
There are 600+ D2C brands & thousands of e-commerce brands that have come up in the last few years, but with access to funding limited to more established brands only, a higher level of consolidation is inevitable in the current times.

The Future of the ‘House of Brands’ Model 
 
There has been a lot of concern around further fundraising for the ‘House of Brands’ startups as most of them struggle to raise their next round.
 We believe it was inevitable in this space, as future funding was always going to be linked to two aspects: (a) Acquiring brands quickly and at the right valuation, and (b) Consolidating the acquired brands and showcasing strong growth in each of the acquired brands.
  
 
Last year was a muscle-flexing year for these startups, rolling out maximum number of LoIs (Letter of Intent), winning deals over their counterparts, and closing/announcing fundraising or acquisitions in the media every few weeks.
 However, perhaps what got missed out during this entire process was how these acquired brands would show growth once consolidated under the Thrasio model.
  
 
Few startups like Mensa & Globalbees cornered a large chunk of capital from the markets which helped them stay ahead of their competition in terms of team building & acquisitions whereas startups like Upscalio & 10Club that raised smaller amounts of capital initially are now somewhat struggling to showcase to the investors as to how they can sustainably grow in the future and compete with the larger startups in their space.
 This has led to a lot of skepticism around this model losing its charm and consolidation is expected to happen among these startups.
  
 
Even though, these startups might have taken a back-seat in this calendar year due to various reasons like focus on growth of the current portfolio, being very selective in picking up the right brands, or concerns over future fundraising, the current trend and pace of acquisitions doesn’t seem to be getting impacted at all.
 In fact, these startups have triggered a new avenue for already established players (like Unicorn Startups, Conglomerates, Large Traditional Businesses) to grow inorganically and exponentially by building their own online-first portfolio of brands, in their respective verticals wherein they have been pre-dominantly the category leaders, by leveraging their know-how, infrastructure and network.
 
 
To sum it up, 2022 had a slow beginning with lesser acquisitions being announced, however, we believe the latter half would be exciting to track with new names entering the acquisition space along with larger fundraising announcements from the incumbents.
