 That company has a 20% profit margin, which means it makes up $200K in net profits.
 If we assume the Amazon seller pays himself a $50K salary, that leaves the seller with discretionary earnings of $250K.
 The business can be worth 2-4 times its discretionary earnings.
 This would put the value of the business at between $500K and one million dollars.
